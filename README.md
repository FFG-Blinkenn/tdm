## Garry's Mod - Team Deathmatch Gamemode

I was looking for a more competetive gamemode for my community, so I decided to start coding a public Team Deathmatch Gamemode. This is my first project, and I have only just begun learning GLua, and don't have any prior programming experience. If you have any suggestions or issues, just let me know.
