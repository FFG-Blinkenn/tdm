## Garry's Mod - Team Deathmatch Gamemode

I was looking for a more competetive gamemode for my community, so I decided to start coding a public Team Deathmatch Gamemode. This is my first project, and I have only just begun learning GLua, and don't have any prior programming experience. If you have any suggestions or issues, just let me know.

## Current Version
Alpha 0.00.1

## Installation
Drop the /tdm/ folder into the garrysmod\gamemodes and you are done. 

## Customization
I will be adding ConVars and config files in the future for custom settings.

## TO-DO List
Add ConVars / Config

Custom Scoreboard

More Classes/Weapons

Updated Class Selection gui

Updated Hud
