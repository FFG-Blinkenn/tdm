# Team Deathmatch

I was looking for a more competetive gamemode for my community, so I decided to start coding a public Team Deathmatch Gamemode. This is my first project, and I have only just started learning GLua, and don't have any prior programming experience. If you have any suggestions or issues, just let me know.

## Current Version

Alpha 0.04

## Installation

Drop the /tdm/ folder into the garrysmod/gamemodes folder and you are done. On your server, set your gamemode to **tdm**.

## TO-DO List

* Custom Scoreboard 
* More Classes/Weapons/Class Balancing
* Updated Class Selection GUI
* Updated Hud -- Current Hud is placeholder
